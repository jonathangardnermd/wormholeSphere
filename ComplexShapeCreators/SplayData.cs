// is the simplest possible curve with a CONSTANT rate of change in the derivative (i.e. a parabola)
// However, since the starting slope along the cylinder is vertical, it's actually infinity/undefined. 
// Therefore, we choose to solve for the curve in a coordinate system where 
// we can model the curve with a symmetric segment of a parabola: the u,v coordinate system that 
// is rotated 45 degrees from the original x,y coordinate system.
// In this coordinate system, the starting slope is -1 and the ending slope is +1 (still a 90 degree change),
// so the math is easier. Once we solve for the curve in the u,v coordinate system, we rotate back to x,y coords.
